Somewhat ordered TODO list
==========================

- Handle UNIX symlinks
- Add basic tests
- Reindent (gently) to KNF.  Today code is a mix of 3 spaces and tabs.
  The included indent.sh script helps, but does not handle comments,
  so be careful to maintain formatting/indentation since it sometimes
  refers to positions in code next to it.
- Replace hard-coded STDARG et al defines with configure checks
- Break out vfprintf() et all replacement functions to a lib/ directory
- Trace any unzoo.c changes that may include code fixes to zoo
- Break apart unzoo.c into the original pieces, increase code sharing
