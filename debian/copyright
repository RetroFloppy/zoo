 Hi, the last release of the zoo archive program was marked entirely
 public domain, with no restrictions. I'm sure this statement will be
 found somewhere in the files in the sources. If not, I hope this email
 will suffice:  everything in the zoo package is entirely public domain,
 with no restrictions whatsoever.
