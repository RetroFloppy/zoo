Subject: Re: License of Zoo

Hi, the last release of the zoo archive program was marked entirely
public domain, with no restrictions. I'm sure this statement will be
found somewhere in the files in the sources. If not, I hope this email
will suffice:  everything in the zoo package is entirely public domain,
with no restrictions whatsoever.
